# Project Details

# Title: 
Weakly Supervised Learning for Industrial Optical Inspection 
(This is work done for one of class projects for graduate level course - CS 591 Algorithms for Data Guided Business Intelligence).

In this class project, worked on developing a model to detect defects by employing Industrial Optical Inspection data on Textured Surfaces. Approached this problem as an Image Segmentation task.

# Approach: 
Deep learning approach followed is based on the paper U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation

# Data description:
The data is artificially generated, but similar to real world problems. The first six out of ten datasets, denoted as development datasets, are supposed to be used for algorithm development. The remaining four datasets, which are referred to as competition datasets, can be used to evaluate the performance. Researchers should consider not using or analyzing the competition datasets before the development is completed as a code of honour.
In the following we provide some details about the datasets:
* Each development (competition) dataset consists of 1000 (2000) 'non-defective' and of 150 (300) 'defective' images saved in grayscale 8-bit PNG format.
* Each dataset is generated by a different texture model and defect model.
* 'Non-defective' images show the background texture without defects, 'defective' images have exactly one
labelled defect on the background texture.
* All datasets has been randomly split into a training and testing sub-dataset of equal size.
* Weak labels are provided as ellipses roughly indicating the defective area. Technically, defective images are
augmented with a separate grayscale 8-bit image in the PNG format located in a folder 'Label'. The values 0 and 255 denote background and defective area, respectively.

All meta-data is subsumed in a separate ASCII textfile called 'Labels.txt' which is located in the 'Label' folder. The structure is as follows:
1 \n
[id of item no. 1] \t [0 if non-defective, 1 if defective] \t [filename of raw image no. 1] \t 0 \t [filename of label image no. 1 if defective, 0 otherwise] \n
...
[id of item no. N] \t [0 if non-defective, 1 if defective] \t [filename of raw image no. N] \t 0 \t [filename of label image no. N if defective, 0 otherwise] \n
The following figure illustrates one defective image from each of the ten datasets.

# defectSegmentation
In this project, I developed a model to detect defects by Industrial Optical Inspection on Textured Surfaces, modelled as an Image Segmentation task.

The dataset I used is described here: https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/node/3616

There are many ways to solve this problem. I attempted to solve this using deep learning and the approach that I followed is based on the paper on U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation.

Project Setup The project was done using a high-level library Keras. For training the deep neural networks using a GPU, the training was performed using Google's Colab service.

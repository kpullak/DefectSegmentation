# Project Details

# Title: 
Defect Segmentation (This is work done for one of class projects for graduate level course - CS 591 Algorithms for Data Guided Business Intelligence).

In this class project, worked on developing a model to detect defects by employing Industrial Optical Inspection data on Textured Surfaces. Approached this problem as an Image Segmentation task.

# Approach: 
Deep learning approach followed is based on the paper U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation

# Resources:
1. Keras
2. Google Colab
3. GPUs on Google Colab
4. Dataset: https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/node/3616
